          <p>This project requires you to utilize your <strong>HTML and CSS </strong>skills to build out a personal blog website,
          including custom images, layout, and styling. Along with webpage design considerations, you'll work to 
          appropriately structure your files, as well as use proper CSS and HTML formatting & style.</p>
          <p><u>Project Files</u> 
            In this project, you'll get to start from scratch! To complete the project, you are able to decide on the 
            HTML and CSS files to include as part of your work, given that the end result is within the confines of the 
            project rubric provided below. 
            This should include, at minimum, HTML files related to:
            </p>
          <p><strong>The blog website</strong> and <strong>a blog post</strong> as well as any related CSS files for styling.
            Make sure to see the earlier section on Development Strategy if you are unsure how to get started.
            <em>our project will be evaluated by </em> code reviewer according to the Personal Blog Website</p>
